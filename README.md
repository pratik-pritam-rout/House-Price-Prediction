# üè† House Price Prediction

This project predicts housing prices using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the **California Housing Dataset** and applies **Linear Regression** to build a predictive model.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately predicts the price of a house based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, etc.
